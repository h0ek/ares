# Ares Project

**Ares** is a virtual machine for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) based on [Xubuntu LTS](https://xubuntu.org/download/).
This machine is something similar to [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) or [Parrot OS](https://parrotlinux.org/), but lightweight, with less tools. There are only tools that I used at least once, and I find them useful, with time there will probably be more and more of them. You can also add your own. I am using it as my machine for learning and bounty programs. Maybe it will be useful to someone.

## Name

> Ares (/ˈɛəriːz/; Ancient Greek: Ἄρης, Áres [árɛːs]) is the Greek god of war. He is one of the Twelve Olympians, the son of Zeus and Hera. In Greek literature, he often represents the physical or violent and untamed aspect of war and is the personification of sheer brutality, in contrast to his sister, the armored Athena, whose functions as a goddess of intelligence include military strategy and generalship.
